Utilizing the GIPHY API, we are able to generate GIFs based on a variety of search terms. To get started, select one of the preset GIF interfaces by clicking on a link in the navigation bar on the top right of the page. On the page you select, there will be a variety of buttons ready for you to press. Pick whichever you'd like and ten GIFs will be generated. To play a GIF, click on it. Click again to stop playback. There is also a form for you to create your own buttons to display any GIF of your choice. Enjoy!
